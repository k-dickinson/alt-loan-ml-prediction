This project implements a **production-ready machine learning pipeline** for alternative credit scoring that predicts loan default probability using alternative data sources, **completely excluding traditional credit score and credit history information**.

## Project Overview

Traditional credit scoring relies heavily on credit history, credit scores, and previous loan performance. This alternative approach uses **alternative data sources** to evaluate creditworthiness, making it suitable for:

- **Individuals with limited or no credit history**
- **New immigrants or young adults**
- **People rebuilding their credit**
- **Markets where traditional credit data is unavailable**
- **Financial inclusion initiatives**

## Key Features

### ✅ **Alternative Data Sources Used**
- **Demographic Information**: Age, marital status, number of dependents
- **Financial Profile**: Annual income, monthly income, savings/checking balances
- **Employment Data**: Employment status, job tenure, experience level
- **Education**: Education level
- **Housing**: Home ownership status
- **Loan Characteristics**: Loan amount, duration, purpose, monthly payments
- **Financial Ratios**: Debt-to-income ratio, total debt-to-income ratio
- **Payment Behavior**: Utility bills payment history
- **Asset Information**: Total assets, liabilities, net worth
- **Interest Rates**: Base and actual interest rates

### ❌ **Excluded Traditional Credit Features**
- Credit score
- Number of open credit lines
- Number of credit inquiries
- Length of credit history
- Payment history
- Previous loan defaults
- Bankruptcy history
- Credit card utilization rate

## Model Architecture

### **Algorithm Choice: LightGBM**
We chose **LightGBM** over XGBoost for the following reasons:

1. **Categorical Feature Handling**: Native support for categorical features, crucial for this dataset
2. **Speed**: Generally faster to train, especially with large datasets
3. **Memory Efficiency**: More memory-efficient than XGBoost
4. **Gradient-based One-Side Sampling**: Reduces overfitting while maintaining accuracy
5. **Leaf-wise Growth**: Often produces better accuracy than level-wise growth

### **Model Features**
- **Cross-validation** with early stopping to prevent overfitting
- **Feature encoding**: Frequency encoding for high-cardinality features, label encoding for low-cardinality
- **Missing value handling**: Median imputation for numerical, mode for categorical
- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Stratified sampling**: Ensures balanced representation in train/test splits

## Performance Metrics

The model evaluates performance using:
- **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed breakdown of predictions vs actual outcomes
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Important for imbalanced datasets

## Model Interpretability

### **Feature Importance Analysis**
- **Traditional importance scores**: Bar chart of most important features
- **Business rules**: Actionable recommendations for loan approval
- **Risk assessment**: Clear probability-based decision making

### **Business Rules**
The model generates loan approval recommendations based on default probability:
- **Low Risk (< 30%)**: ✅ APPROVE
- **Medium Risk (30-60%)**: ⚠️ REVIEW
- **High Risk (> 60%)**: ❌ DECLINE

## 📈 Model Performance

Our alternative credit scoring model achieves excellent performance:

- **AUC Score**: 0.9588 (Excellent discrimination ability)
- **F1 Score**: 0.9349 (Strong precision and recall balance)
- **Accuracy**: 89.88% (High overall accuracy)
- **No Overfitting**: Training and testing performance are closely aligned

## Usage Example

### **Example Prediction**

```python
# Sample applicant data
applicant = {
    'Age': 35,
    'AnnualIncome': 50000,
    'EmploymentStatus': 'Employed',
    'EducationLevel': 'Bachelor',
    'Experience': 10,
    'LoanAmount': 20000,
    'LoanDuration': 36,
    'MaritalStatus': 'Married',
    'NumberOfDependents': 2,
    'HomeOwnershipStatus': 'Mortgage',
    'MonthlyDebtPayments': 500,
    'LoanPurpose': 'Debt Consolidation',
    'SavingsAccountBalance': 5000,
    'CheckingAccountBalance': 2000,
    'TotalAssets': 100000,
    'TotalLiabilities': 50000,
    'MonthlyIncome': 4000,
    'UtilityBillsPaymentHistory': 5,
    'JobTenure': 5,
    'NetWorth': 50000,
    'BaseInterestRate': 5.0,
    'InterestRate': 7.0,
    'MonthlyLoanPayment': 600,
    'TotalDebtToIncomeRatio': 0.3
}

# Get prediction
prediction = scorer.predict_loan_approval(applicant)
print(f"Recommendation: {prediction['recommendation']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {prediction['risk_level']}")
```
